# LamDel - work is in progress
Simple and fast Math expression parser library that supports custom variable and functions.

The LamDel library is a math expression parses and evaluater that parses and evaluates string expressions in O(n) time complexity, when n is the expression's length, using a single passage over the string.  
It supports both Unary and Binary operators in addition to variables and functions. Functions and Operators can be added, updated and changed by the user during runtime.  

The engine was created with a custom algorithm that is similar but not identical to the Shunting yard algorithm. Eventually, I would like to provide both implementations to be able to compare their speed and implementations simplicity.
